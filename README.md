# Shore Thing Figma Integration

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Figma design system integration for the Shore Thing application. Shore Thing is a comprehensive coastal management and marine information platform that provides users with real-time data, analytics, and tools for coastal activities.

This project bridges the gap between design and development by maintaining a synchronized design system that ensures consistency across all Shore Thing application interfaces. The integration enables seamless design-to-code workflows, automated component generation, and systematic style management.

## Design System Integration Goals

### 1. Component Library Synchronization
- Maintain a comprehensive library of reusable UI components that mirror Figma designs
- Establish automated workflows for extracting component specifications from Figma
- Ensure pixel-perfect implementation of design components in code
- Enable bi-directional updates between Figma and codebase

### 2. Style System Management
- Extract and maintain design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.)
- Implement a scalable token architecture using CSS variables and theme configuration
- Support light/dark mode and accessibility variations
- Version control for design system updates and changes

### 3. Documentation & Collaboration
- Provide comprehensive documentation for designers and developers
- Establish clear handoff processes and communication protocols
- Create usage guidelines and best practices for component implementation
- Maintain a single source of truth for design specifications

### 4. Developer Experience
- Streamline the design-to-code workflow
- Reduce manual translation of designs into components
- Enable rapid prototyping with pre-built, design-approved components
- Minimize design-development discrepancies

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Initialize repository structure and development environment
- [ ] Connect Figma API and establish authentication
- [ ] Set up design token extraction pipeline
- [ ] Create base configuration and build tools
- [ ] Document development workflow and contribution guidelines

### Phase 2: Design Token System (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Extract core design tokens from Figma (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Implement token transformation pipeline
- [ ] Generate CSS variables and theme configuration files
- [ ] Create token documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Set up automated token sync workflow

### Phase 3: Component Library Development (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Audit and catalog all Figma components
- [ ] Prioritize components by usage frequency and complexity
- [ ] Develop core components (buttons, inputs, cards, navigation)
- [ ] Implement advanced components (modals, data tables, charts)
- [ ] Create component documentation with live examples
- [ ] Establish component testing and quality assurance processes

### Phase 4: Integration & Tooling (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] Integrate design system into Shore Thing application
- [ ] Create Figma plugin for enhanced designer-developer collaboration
- [ ] Implement automated visual regression testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for design system updates
- [ ] Create migration guides for existing components

### Phase 5: Documentation & Maintenance (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] Complete comprehensive documentation site
- [ ] Create video tutorials and onboarding materials
- [ ] Establish governance model and update procedures
- [ ] Set up feedback and issue tracking system
- [ ] Plan regular design system reviews and updates
